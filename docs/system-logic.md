# Story Spark System Logic

This document explains the core system behaviors that govern how Story Spark functions behind the scenes. These behaviors include routing rules, redirect logic, upsell triggers, and state transitions. Together, they ensure that every user interaction is predictable, guided, and aligned with Story Spark’s storytelling purpose.

The logic described here reflects how a production-ready GPT application would be structured using modular, testable architecture.

# 🧠 Overview of System Logic Components

Story Spark uses four key system logic files located in the `/src/system/` directory:

router.js
state-manager.js
redirect-logic.js
upsell-logic.js


Each file has a single responsibility.  
Together, they form the backbone of the Story Spark experience.

# 🔀 1. Router Logic (`router.js`)

The router determines **which module comes next** based on:

- current module  
- state  
- optional module overrides (`result.nextModule`)  

This creates a controlled, linear flow that follows the core sequence:

Idea Spark → World Seed → Character Forge → Plot Skeleton → Wordsmith Lab → Complete


### Why a Router?

- Enforces predictable progression  
- Keeps modules independent  
- Allows branching or alternate flows in the future  
- Mimics real-world state-machine behavior  
- Prevents spaghetti logic across modules  

### Example routing decision:

```text
Current module: "world-seed"
Router returns: "character-forge"

```
If a module ever explicitly sets result.nextModule, that value overrides the router’s default logic.
This makes the system extensible and future-proof.

# 🧱 2. State Manager (`state-manager.js`)

The state manager maintains all session-related information:

- `currentModule`  
- `history` of interactions  
- `metadata` (for future uses)

### Why centralized state?

- Predictability  
- Simple debugging  
- Easy expansion  
- Avoids mismatched variable passing  
- Supports future persistence (Supabase)

Each call updates the state by:

1. Changing the active module  
2. Adding the user-message → module-response pair to `history`  
3. Preserving metadata across modules

### Example state snapshot:

```json
{
  "currentModule": "plot-skeleton",
  "history": [
    { "module": "idea-spark", "input": "...", "output": "..." },
    { "module": "world-seed", "input": "...", "output": "..." }
  ],
  "metadata": {}
}

```

# 🔒 3. Redirect Logic (`redirect-logic.js`)

Redirect logic ensures Story Spark stays focused on **storytelling** by intercepting:

- business questions  
- legal issues  
- mental health topics  
- coding/programming  
- finance  
- anything outside the narrative domain  

### How redirect logic works

1. The user enters a message  
2. The system checks if it contains off-topic or disallowed content  
3. If yes → Story Spark returns a **redirect message** and does *not* pass the input to the module  
4. If no → the input continues into the active module

### Redirect flow diagram:

User Input
↓
Redirect Logic Check?
│
├── Yes → respond with redirect message, halt module
↓
└── No → pass input to current module


Redirect messages rotate through a set of variations to keep the experience warm and conversational.

### Why this matters

- Keeps interactions on mission  
- Protects the GPT system from drifting  
- Reflects real-world safety and domain guardrails  
- Ensures every module receives valid inputs

# 🌟 4. Upsell Logic (upsell-logic.js)

Upsell logic provides gentle, non-intrusive nudges when the user expresses interest in advanced features available in the Story Engine GPT.

Trigger words include:

“advanced outline”

“custom structure”

“detailed beat sheet”

“non-free tools”

“premium workflow”

How upsell logic works:

The module processes input normally

Story Spark checks if the user’s request matches an upsell trigger

If yes → an optional upsell note is appended to the output

The message is always optional, never blocking

Example upsell message:

FYI — the Story Engine GPT can autofill advanced frameworks and export full beat sheets when you're ready to go deeper!

Why this matters:

Creates value pathways into the larger product ecosystem

Mirrors standard SaaS upgrade patterns

Keeps creative flow uninterrupted

# 🔗 5. The Interaction Pipeline

Every user message flows through Story Spark using this sequence:

User Input
   ↓
Redirect Logic
   ↓
Router → Determines Current Module
   ↓
Module Logic (Idea Spark, World Seed, etc.)
   ↓
Upsell Logic
   ↓
State Updates
   ↓
Formatted Output to User

This ensures:

predictable behavior

strong guardrails

consistent output

controlled transitions

expandable integration points

# 🔮 6. Future Enhancements to System Logic

As Story Spark evolves into a full app, system logic will expand to include:

Session persistence

Supabase or Vercel KV to store full story sessions.

Branching pathways

Alternate flows like:

genre-specific flows

advanced “pro mode”

returning to earlier modules

multi-module revisions

Telemetry

Module analytics to help improve GPT prompts over time.

Middleware

API middleware to pre-process inputs or cache outputs.

Rate limiting

To protect the app at scale.

TypeScript migration

Full typing for stronger safety and predictability.

---

# 🏁 Summary

The system logic layer ensures Story Spark behaves like a modular, professional-grade application:

Router → controls flow

State manager → tracks progress

Redirect logic → enforces domain boundaries

Upsell logic → enhances product strategy

Together, these components form the connective tissue of the entire Story Spark architecture.

This foundation is ready for future evolution into a fully coded Next.js + Supabase + Vercel application.
